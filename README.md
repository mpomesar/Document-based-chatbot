# Document-based Chatbot

### What is a chatbot?

A chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. â€” Wikipedia

This repository contains code for building a document based chatbot. So just copy data from any website or datasource. Copy and paste the whole data in a text format. Then train ML model on this data and then interact with the chatbot and see its accuracy. Apart from this, I have also included Wikipedia python library so you can ask anything which is not present in the input document.
